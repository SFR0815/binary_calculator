# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `binary_calculator`
   - **Description:** Pure binary arithmetic operations - Educational library with 53 examples
   - **Visibility:** Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Link Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. 

GitHub will show you commands like:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/binary_calculator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Run These Commands

Copy your actual GitHub username and run:

```bash
cd s:\Documents\SFR\Programming\python\binary_cals

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/binary_calculator.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Update Package URLs

After creating the repository, update these files with your actual GitHub username:

**setup.py** - Lines with YOUR_USERNAME
**pyproject.toml** - Lines with YOUR_USERNAME

## What's Been Prepared

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ Initial commit created (91 files, 18,829 lines)
✅ .gitignore configured
✅ Package structure complete
✅ License added (MIT)
✅ Setup files created

## Quick Commands After GitHub Repo is Created

```bash
# Set your GitHub username
set GITHUB_USER=your_actual_username

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/%GITHUB_USER%/binary_calculator.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
